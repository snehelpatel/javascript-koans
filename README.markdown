# javascript-koans/reaching enlightenment


Our goal for this assignment was to make each test pass and each individual .js file was a review in concepts we already learned.
The review involved creating and manipulating and discerning between arrays, functions, higher order functions, objects, methods, inherited values, variable scope, mutability. Then we put it together, causing some amount of confusion.
